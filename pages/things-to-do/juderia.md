      The Jewish Community of the Island of Rhodes has a rich history that dates back to the second century BC, with the earliest reference to it appearing in the book of Maccabees. Other references to the Jewish presence in the Island are found in the writings of the Jewish historian Josephus Flavius. The Jews of Rhodes like the other Jews living in Greece and in its Islands spoke Greek and conducted the religious services in Greek, following the Romaniote rite, which is distinct from Sephardi, Ashkenaz, and Italian rites.

      The Jewish community in Rhodes was most affected within the last 500 years by the influx of Jews from Spain, who fled at the time of the Spanish Inquisition. Their descendants are referred to as Sephardic Jews, derived from "Sepharad", the Hebrew word for Spain. These Jews brought with them their culture, their customs and traditions, one amongst the cultural aspects was linguistic, the language they spoke was Espanyol, as they called it, also referred to as a Ladino and "Judeo-Spanish". The Jewish Quarter of the mediaeval town was affectionately known as **"La Juderia"**.

      At the start of the 20th century, many young Jews left the Island in search of higher economic opportunities in America and in Africa. In the early 1920s the community had reached its peak population of 4.500 souls. In 1943 Rhodes was taken by the Germans, and on July 23 of the subsequent year, 1673 members of the Jewish community were arrested and deported to the Auschwitz extermination camp, where most of them were slaughtered. Only 151 survived. In 1947 the Island was ceded to Greece. Today there are not many of Jews living in Rhodes.

      **The Square of the Jewish Martyrs in Rhodes** (known in Greek as Evreon Martyron) is found within the heart of the previous Jewish Quarter. The Square was originally a region of Jewish homes and little shops. However, the area was bombed during World War II, and in its place was established a tiny little park and square. The present fountain ornamented with three seahorses replaced a previous fountain that was destroyed during WWII. The Holocaust Memorial was dedicated on June 23, 2002, in memory of the World War II victims from the islands of Rhodes and Cos.

      **Rhodes Synagogue - The Kahal Shalom Synagogue**. Built in the year 1577, the Kahal Shalom is the oldest synagogue in Greece and the sole remaining Jewish synagogue on Rhodes still actively holding services. the complete name of the building is Kahal Kadosh Shalom (Holy Congregation of Peace). The inside of the Kahal Shalom Synagogue follows the standard Sephardic type of having the "tevah" (the prayer reading table) within the center of the sanctuary facing southeast toward Jerusalem. As a result of a liberalization of religious policy, in 1935 a balcony was created to be used as a women's prayer area. Before that point the ladies sat within the rooms adjacent to the south wall of the synagogue that viewed the sanctuary through curtained openings. Those rooms are converted into the Jewish Museum of Rhodes.
