### RHODES NEW TOWN & ACROPOLIS

From the cruise ship dock/pier we drive up the hillside to **Monte Smith**, **Acropolis of Rhodes City**, for a panoramic view of the city. (Stop Visit Photos)

We will also view the north point of the island where the **Mediterranean Sea** (east coast) and the **Aegean Sea** (west coast) meet.

### THE EMERY WINERY

We visit the **cellar of the Emery Winery**, the second biggest wine producer on the island, for more free wine tasting. The Emery winery, still one of the largest in Greece, was built in 1974 in the village of Embona and run by **Triantafillou family**. Decades of collaboration with local vine growers from the region, coupled with their own expertise and commitment, have enabled them to build a distinctive range of quality wines from unique Greek varietals, know since ancient times. The name Emery originates from **Emery D'Amboise** of French origin who was the Great Magistrate of Rhodes from 1503-1512. (Stop Visit Taste Photos)

Here the philosophy of the winemaking focuses on the production of high quality wine that is bind by the ecosystem of mount Ataviros and expresses the uniqueness of the natural surroundings. To achieve this goal, the cultivation and vinification take place under special catering, using not only the knowledge but also by merging tradition with technology. (Stop Visit Taste Photos)

### BACK TO THE SHIP (or to the STARTING POINT)
