    2. To reach the Acropolis of Lindos you will be required to climb 292 steps, or ride on a donkey. The donkey does not eliminate all the steps, there are over 80 to go when you get off the donkey. The donkeys go by a slightly different path so the stairs, and the soles of your shoes, will be quite clean if you wish to walk up. The risers of the stairs are 5-7 inches and the treads 18-24 inches. No handrail on either side.
    3. If you have elderly people in your group, we can drive them down on the beautiful beach of Lindos have a drink and a nice discuss with the driver and enjoy the panoramic view while they are waiting for you to climb up the Acropolis of Lindos.
    4. If you have kids in your group the "**Best of Rhodes Shore Excursion**" it is also an Educational and Entertainment Excursion, and of course they will love the donkey ride up to the Acropolis of Lindos!!
    5. You may prefer to use ATM machines when you need cash. ATMs are everywhere.
