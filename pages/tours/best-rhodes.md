### RHODES MEDIEVAL CITY

Starting from the pier or your chosen departure point, we will transport you to the Medieval City, a designated World Heritage Site. Here, you'll have the opportunity to capture photos of the walls and significant gates from outside.  

Due to a recent traffic regulation, vehicles are restricted from entering the Old Town, making it accessible only to pedestrians.

However, we can conclude the tour at one of the Old Town gates, allowing you the freedom to explore independently and stroll back to the ship. The walk from the Medieval City to the Cruise Port takes just 10 minutes, enabling you to save both time and money by avoiding any waiting-time charges for the driver.

### RHODES NEW TOWN

We continue to the **"New Town"**. Here we will see/visit:

The historical buildings where the Venetian, Gothic and Oriental elements blend:

- The **Mandraki** **Old Harbor**, where according to tradition, the **Colossus of Rhodes, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World**, once stood (two bronze deer statues mark the site). (Stop Visit Photos)
- The **Church of the Annunciation (Evangelismos)**, an example of Medieval Catholic design with amazing wall paintings and impressive chandeliers, that today is the Orthodox town's cathedral. (Stop Visit Photos)
- The **City Hall**, the **Administration building** or **Governor's Palace** a Venetian Gothic and Renaissance style with details of the Doges' Palace in Venice (today the offices of the Prefecture of the Dodecanese), The **National Theatre of Rhodes**, and the **"Hotel of the Roses" **(today the Casino of Rhodes).
- The **North Point of the island** where the East Coast's Mediterranean Sea, and the West Coast's Aegean Sea meet.

### MONTE SMITH

We drive up the hillside to **Monte Smith**, (although named after a 19th century British admiral, this is the site of ancient Rhodes) the **Acropolis of Rhodes City** which overlooks the Old and the New Town. Enjoy excellent views of the city and both East and West Coast. (Stop Visit Photos). You can also see from a distance the **Temple of Apollo**, the **Ancient Stadium of Rhodes**, and the restored marble **Hellenistic Theater**. (Stop Photos)

### THE JOURNEY TO LINDOS

The drive continues 50 kilometers / 32 miles southeast to **Lindos**. You'll pass small picturesque villages and enjoy dramatic views of the sea and the beautiful landscape of orange and lemon groves, and olive trees.

### ANTHONY QUINN BAY

On the way you visit the Anthony Quinn Bay - Takes its name from the famous Hollywood actor, who owns a large property in this area. Since filming the Guns of Navarone in Rhodes Island - scenic (Stop Visit Photos). We continue south east to Lindos, a short stop at a vantage point for the panoramic view of Tsambica beach - scenic (Stop Photos)

### RHODES TRADITIONAL POTTERY ART

On the way to Lindos, you can choose an optional short stop at a pottery workshop where the traditional pottery of Rhodes is made. You can even learn the mystery of the Pythagorean cup. Just let your tour/driver know that you wish to make this short stop.

### PANORAMIC VIEW OF LINDOS

One mile before Lindos we stop at a vantage point for a panoramic view of the acropolis, the village, and the port of Lindos. (Stop Photos)

### ST PAUL'S BAY

Next, we drive down to **St. Paul's Bay**, a site of incredible wild beauty. Here is where the apostle is said to have landed in the year 51 AD to preach Christianity to the Rhodians. From this point, you can also view the cave where **"The Guns of Navarone"** was filmed. (Stop Visit Photos)

### LINDOS VILLAGE AND ACROPOLIS

Next, we take you to the main square of Lindos Village, where you have two options:

**Option 1:**<br>
Wander through the charming whitewashed village, passing colorful storefronts and beautifully decorated homes, before ascending to the Acropolis of Lindos. Explore the awe-inspiring remnants of ancient civilizations, including the 4th-century BC Doric Temple of Athena Lindia, a double-winged portico, a Byzantine church, and the impressive fortifications built by the Knights of St. John. (Stop, Visit, Pictures)

**Option 2:**<br>
If you'd rather avoid the climb up 292 steps, your tour driver can take you to scenic vantage points for stunning views and photos of the Acropolis from a distance. This way, you can skip the crowds and heat while enjoying more time exploring the picturesque white village. (Stop, Visit, Pictures)

### COAST ROAD OF FALIRAKI AND KALLITHEA

Later we will meet you at the main square of Lindos village (**at the prearranged time**) for the return trip, the last 14 kilometers / 8 miles we drive through the coastal road of Faliraki Beach and Kallithea Spa.

We will take you back to your cruise ship. If you prefer to be taken to the Medieval City for independent browsing, you will be responsible for returning on foot to the ship, docked about a quarter-mile away.
