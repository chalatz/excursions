### RHODES MEDIEVAL CITY

Beginning at the pier or your selected departure point, we will transport you to the Medieval City. Along the way, you'll have the chance to take photos of the impressive walls and notable gates from the outside. The tour will conclude at one of the Old Town gates, giving you the flexibility to explore at your own pace and walk back to the ship. The journey from the Medieval City to the Cruise Port is just a 10-minute walk, allowing you to save both time and money by avoiding additional driver waiting fees.

### RHODES NEW TOWN

We continue to the **"New Town"**. Here we will see/visit:

  - **The Historic Buildings** - Where Venetian, Gothic, and Oriental architectural elements seamlessly blend, creating a unique and captivating aesthetic.

  - **Mandraki Old Harbor** -- Traditionally believed to be the site where the Colossus of Rhodes, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, once stood. (Stop, Visit, Photos)

  - **Church of the Annunciation** -- A stunning example of medieval Catholic architecture, now serving as the Orthodox town's cathedral. Admire its remarkable wall paintings and impressive chandeliers. (Stop, Visit, Photos)

  - **North Point of the Island** -- The meeting point of the Mediterranean Sea on the East Coast and the Aegean Sea on the West Coast, offering a breathtaking natural spectacle.

### THE JOURNEY TO SOUTH WEST

The drive continues south on the West Coast, 40 kilometers / 25 miles through small villages dotted with green forests.

### ANCIENT KAMIROS

We will stop first at **Ancient Kamiros. (Hellenistic City of Kamiros)** The town was founded by the **Dorians**, just like lalyssos and Lindos, and reached its greatest height in the 6th century B.C. If you enjoy ruins, you will not be disappointed by the atmospheric site of Kamiros. The ruins themselves are quite large with huge and **impressive public buildings**: the **Agora Square**, the **Temple of Pythian Apollo**, the **Fountain Square**, the **Sanctuary** dedicated to the Gods and Heroes of Kamiros, the **Baths-House**, the **Main Street**, the **Houses**, and more...

(Stop Visit Photos)

### VALLEY OF THE BUTTERFLIES

On the way back, you visit the **Valley of the Butterflies**. The valley is a unique nature reserve, the site of the only natural forest of Liquidambar orientalis trees in Europe, where the butterflies (Panaxia Quadripunctaria, also known as tiger moth) rest every year to reproduce (Mid-June to Mid-September). Huge numbers of butterflies congregate in this small valley during the final stage of their life cycle. You are permanently surrounded by butterflies camouflaging themselves against the tree trunks as you walk through the valley. Wooden bridges and paths will guide you through the rich vegetation of this rare biotope (Stop Visit Photos)

### THE TRADITIONAL WINERY

We stop at a **traditional (boutique) winery for wine tasting**. Athiri, Red Wine Mandilari, Muscat, Cabernet Sauvignon...Souma (distillate of wine). Winemakers are using organic growth and organic process for the vineyards and wines. Here you can also get your pictures of the ageing facilities.

### FILERIMOS MONASTERY

Next comes a stop at the **Filerimos** (Philerimos), the **Ancient Acropolis of Ialyssos** 876 feet / 267 meter above the sea level. The ancient city of Ialysos extended around the hill of Filerimos, which was the ancient acropolis where there are remains of buildings from the Archaic, Byzantine and Knights' periods. Once we arrive at the top (at the main square) on the left-hand side is the entrance to the **Church of Our Lady of Filerimos**, the **Filerimos Monastery**, and the ruins of 3rd century **temple Athena Polias**. On the right hand side there is a beautiful tree sheltered pathway the **"Via Crucis"** or **"Via Dolorosa"** or **"Golgotha"** also known as the **"Way of the Cross"** or **"Stations of the Cross"**. This is a series of shrines with relief scenes of the Passion, which leads from the main square to the west edge of the plateau to the 16 meter / 48 feet cross, from which you can enjoy a stunning view. You can even climb up the cross and take in the view from the arms.\
The peace and quiet is broken only by the local peacocks, which are all over the place and are delighted to show off their tails to anyone who comes close! (Stop Visit Photos)

### BACK TO THE SHIP (or to the STARTING POINT)

We will take you back to your cruise ship. If you prefer to be taken to the Medieval City for independent browsing, you will be responsible for returning on foot to the ship, docked about a quarter-mile away.
