### VISITING THE MEDIEVAL CITY

Embark on your journey from the Cruise Port where your guided tour through the Medieval City begins. Passing through the St. Catherine Gate, you'll delve into the heart of the Burgos (town) to explore its most significant monuments, capturing memorable moments with photo stops along the way.

### THE EXTERIORS WALLS

The ancient enclave of Rhodes Old Town is enclosed by a formidable 4 km / 2.5 miles of defensive walls constructed by the Knights of St. John on the foundation of Byzantine fortifications. This stands as a prime illustration of the sophisticated fortification methods employed during the 14th to 15th centuries.

### THE INTERIOR WALL

The Medieval City was divided by an east-west interior wall, with the Collachium to the north and the larger Burgo to the south. A vibrant melting pot, the Burgo was home to people from various backgrounds, with the Greeks being the predominant residents

### QUALITY GUIDING SERVICE

Your amiable and enthusiastic **knowledgeable tour guide** will provide a brief history lesson, narrating tales of the medieval neighborhoods, impressive buildings, and the diverse time periods that shaped Rhodes. The city's evolution is evident in the churches, mosques, and synagogues that span centuries, creating a rich tapestry of history (photo stops included).

### OPTIONAL SHORT BREAK

Midway through the tour, enjoy an optional short break for refreshing beverages and coffee.

### COLLACHIO & GRAND MASTERS PALACE

Proceeding towards the Collachio, the smaller northern section of the medieval city, you'll encounter the **Castello -- Grand Masters Palace**, once home to the Grand Masters and the **Administration of the Knights of St. John** (photo stops and a walking tour inside the Grand Master Palace).

### COLLACHIO & THE STREET OF THE KNIGHTS

Descending towards the remarkable **Street of the Knights**, linking the Grand Master Palace to the **New Hospital of the Knights** (now the Archaeological Museum of Rhodes), you'll witness the **Our Lady of the Castel**, now known as the Byzantine Museum (photo stops).

### THE MARINE GATE 

The tour concludes at the Marine Gate, providing the option to be dropped back to your hotel, ship, or to explore the Old Town independently. The Cruise Port is conveniently located within a 10-minute walk from the Old Town.
