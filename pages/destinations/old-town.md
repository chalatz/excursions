      The old town of Rhodes is contained within the 4 km / 2.5 miles of defensive walls that the Knights of St John built on Byzantine fortification. A typical example of the techniques of fortification of the 14th - 15th century. Massive towers and bastions project from several place and they are decorated with elaborate stonework, while a wide dry moat provided the first line of defence.
