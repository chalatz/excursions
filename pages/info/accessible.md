This service is for those travelers who have physical limitations or an aversion to extensive walking and climbing.

### MERCEDES SEDAN CARS FOR WHEELCHAIR USERS

We are pleased to accommodate travelers who use manual wheelchairs in our vehicles. Our sedans have a curb height which makes it possible to easily transfer most passengers from their wheelchairs to our cars. Our sedans are equipped with spacious trunks so that we may easily stow a wheelchair when folded (even electric wheelchair or motorized scooter when folded - usually in smaller parts).

### MINIBUS WITH LIFT FOR WHEELCHAIR USERS

Please note that the Port of Rhodes does not require tendering of passengers going ashore.

We here at “Rhodes Shore Excursions” would appreciate advance notification of passengers needing wheelchair assistance, as we must request permission to drive onto the ship and certain sites around the island.
