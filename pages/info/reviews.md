      Thank you, Nicholas and Manuel, for making our short stay in Rhodes so nice. We promised ourselves to be there again in the future.  Happy new year! Giorgio and family (31 Dec) Italy

      Dear Nicholas, it’s a pleasure to share our wonderful experience with you and Michael - our thanks go out to you both! We wish you a lovely holiday season, 2020, and beyond Warmly, Jeff (Dec 28th) Kent UK

      The pre tour communication was outstanding. On the day of the tour we had a Driver who was very passionate about the island where he lived. His narrative was exceptional and easy to understand. Overall, we visited the majority of the ships excursion destinations in our single private tour. We could not recommend this tour operator any more highly.  Mark (Dec 9th) N.Y

      Nicholas, Thanks for your great Service. Emanuel did a great job. Hope to get back to Rhodes someday.  Roger and Pam (Oct 30th) Cleveland, Ohio

      Dear Nicholas, We had a fabulous time and can’t thank you enough for providing us with such an enjoyable and professional tour. Michael was an outstanding tour/driver. Since he is local to Rhodes, he was able to share very interesting facts that others might not know. Thank you again. Best regards, Jim and Mimi, Nancy and Kevin (Oct 23rd) Tulsa, Oklahoma

      Nicholas, Had a wonderful time on Rhodes and you have a beautiful island and Kostas was an amazing tour guide. Certainly, will consider a future return to enjoy more to the sites.  Mike (Oct 20th) Minneapolis USA

      Hi Nicholas, I put pictures on Facebook and already had a friend ask for your information. It was a great day! Emmanuel took good care of us. Thanks. Barbara (Oct 18th) Oakland, Calif

      Nicholas, We really enjoyed the trip. Kostas the tour guide and Jacob the driver, were both excellent. Kostas especially informed regarding the history of Rhodes. Would definitely recommend to anyone.  Kevin (Oct 13th) Miami, Fla.

      Hello, Nicholas! We all four were really impressed with Michael. We LOVED Rhodes and want to return. I had done my research and looked at photos on-line, but was not prepared for such beauty.   Michael answered any questions we asked him and we liked his humor. I personally LOVED the cruise port/harbor area and the history associated with it. I hope to return and take more photos of this area.    The couple traveling with us could not get over the beauty of the water with the turquoise and indigo waters! I think we were all surprised how close Turkey is! I Thank you for everything, Nicholas! Thank Michael for us also. You are lucky to live in such a beautiful place. Enjoy it for us.  Lucinda (Oct 9th) Raleigh, N.C. USA

      Nicholas, we had an outstanding Tour, thanks to you and Mike.  Michael (Oct 6th) Colorado Springs

      Yannis was wonderful. He was a great driver and showed us so much of your beautiful island. Rhodes is our favorite part of Greece so far. He gave us so much information and took us to many places, as well as all of the places we wanted to go. We highly recommend your company and Yannis. Thank you so MUCH.  Cheri (Oct 1st) Omaha, Nebr. USA

      Thank you, Nicholas, Angelos was very nice and everything went well. We will refer your services with high marks.  Kind regards, James (Sept 28th) Southampton UK

      Hi Nicholas, Thank you so much for the wonderful tour of Rhodes. Our family thoroughly enjoyed every moment and we all agree Rhodes was our favorite stop along the whole cruise. My sister and I are already brainstorming when we can get back there! Liana and Yannis were amazing, so thoughtful and considerate of our family’s needs throughout the entire trip. We can’t thank you all enough for truly making our family vacation a memorable one. Please extend our gratitude to Liana and Yannis and we will be sure to book with you again when we return to Rhodes!  Sincerely, Ashley R. (Aug 6th) Columbus, Ohio

      Nicholas thank you. We had a brilliant time. We have just returned home and have wonderful memories of Rhodes. Louise said Rhodes was her favorite out of all the places we visited. Greetings to Dominic. He was a very informative and safe driver.  Leanne (July 15th) Fort Worth, Texas

      Our private tour exceeded my expectations and our driver Emanouel was just... amazing. We got to see soft white sandy beaches and super quaint local treasures. We also experienced beautiful Lindos from all sorts of angles and an amazing pottery shop that has been around for generations where we purchased many treasures from our journey. We also chose to add an extra hour so we could enjoy an amazing authentic Greek meal at Argos, the most picturesque place I saw on the island. When the day comes that I get back to Rhodes or if any of my friends go, there is no doubt we will seek Nicholas and Emanouel out!  Nicole and Kerri (July 8th) Charlotte, N.C. USA

      Hi Nicholas, I wanted to let you know I left a review on TripAdvisor and gave the tour 5 stars. Kostas was an excellent tour guide and we truly appreciated everything he did especially when most in our group were tired and only wanted lunch, he made sure to go with myself and my wife to the Acropolis which ended up being the best part of the day. We truly thank him for going that extra mile for us and making sure we got to see it.  Many thanks, Jason & Jennifer (June 12th) Detroit, Mich. USA

      Nicholas, Emmanuel was wonderful and we couldn’t have been more pleased with our short visit to Rhodes. Thank you and Emmanuel for making it memorable. Linda (June 10th) El Paso, Texas

      On arrival in Rhodes by ship we were promptly met by our tour-driver Emanuel. He gave us a comprehensive tour of the city and we then went to the harbor entrance where we had time to admire the very decorative Church of the Annunciation. We then went to where the Aegean Sea meets the Mediterranean Sea and saw ancient buildings. Emanuel also took us to Lindos and the Acropolis and finally we went to St Paul’s Bay. Our tour was well organized and Emanuel was interesting and informative. We would recommend that any visitors to Rhodes should book a tour through Nicholas Rhodes Private Tours. The process was easy and the day was memorable.  David and Sue (Dec 18th) Sacramento, California

      Dear Nicholas, We thoroughly enjoyed our tour with your company on Nov. 5th! Andrew was an awesome driver. He’s a real gem! Can’t stop thinking of all those beautiful hotels that are standing empty at this time of year. Hope to return to your beautiful island!!  Best regards, Jeanne (Dec 5th) Kansas City, Mo

      Nicholas, We all had a great time in Rhodes. We saw so many interesting locations and learned a lot about the area. Thanks Again  Brian (Nov 28th) Mesa, Arizona

      Nicholas, This by far was the BEST tour we have had. Dominic was like family to us. There is absolutely no way you can improve. Thank you again and we hope to see you again. Marlene and Jon (Nov 7th) Atlanta, Ga.

      We very much enjoyed our visit to Rhodes. Your service was excellent from making the reservation through the warm welcome at the port and the morning tour. Stathis was friendly, Informative, and good company. And his recommendation for lunch was excellent.  Thank you for a memorable visit to Rhodes!  Kind regards, Laura (Nov 2nd) Virginia Beach, Va.

      Thank you so much. We loved our tour and will definitely recommend it to anyone. You are very prompt, professional and everything was as promised.  Sharon and Tony (Oct 30th) UK

      We had a fabulous time, Kosta was amazing and really made our day special!  We will be posting a review on TripAdvisor!!  Thank you so much,  Linda (Oct 23rd) Colorado Springs

      Hi Nicholas, the tour was perfect! We enjoyed it thoroughly. Thank you very much, Michael and Sergio!  Mrs. Cheng (Oct 20th) Taiwan

      Nicholas, thank you for giving us Michael. He was a wonderful, pleasant person and driver and very knowledgeable. We had a terrific tour and he topped it by bringing us to a wonderful restaurant. We would highly recommend your company to any of our friends. This was one of the best tours on our trip.  Thanks again  Mart (Oct 9th) Toronto Canada

      We would like to thank you for the wonderful day that we had using your company for our tour of Rhodes. Their were 8 of us traveling together & we had 2 cars. We had Michael as our driver, he was very informative, give us many facts of your beautiful island & answered all of our questions. We chose your company instead of doing a tour with the cruise ship & we were very happy that we did that. We customized our tour, no problem with that. A couple highlights of our tour were the stop at St. Paul’s Bay for a photo opportunity & the very beautiful spot that we stopped at to have a nice lunch. We escaped the crowds from the cruise ship & had a wonderful day!  Marilyn Haight (Oct 8th) Raleigh, N.C.

      Hi, All I can say is WOW what a magnificent day and what a magnificent place. On a scale from 1 - 10, I would rate our experience as 11.5. Mike is truly a great ambassador for your Company and Country. We will recommend your company to everyone.  Regards Phil (Oct 8th) Oakland, Calif.

      Thank you! It was a high point of our trip. Great job! Cathy (Oct 7th) Tulsa, Okla.

      Hi Nicholas, We had a fantastic day. Dominic was an outstanding guide and we really enjoyed his company and commentary. We certainly understand more about olives and olive oil than we did 24 hours ago. You are lucky to have a relationship with someone of his caliber.  We have thoroughly enjoyed our visit to your beautiful island. We are from Australia and our civilized history dates back 200 years. Rhodes has thousands of years of history which is amazing for us.  Hopefully we will be back one day and get to see more.  Kind regards.  Peter and Liz Oct 7th) Melbourne AU

      We did a tour with Rhodes Private Tours. Nicholas was the owner and our driver was Michael. We had the best tour with them. He took us to all the beautiful bays that are on Rhodes and told us that the movie The Guns of Navarone was made here. There is a bay named Anthony Quinn Bay after the actor who was in the movie. We were on a cruise, if you had more time it would be a nice place to spend a week.  Gail (Oct 4th) Cleveland, Ohio

      Thank you for the awesome experience on your island. It is so beautiful! We had a great time and learned a lot. Please tell Kostas we appreciate his knowledge and hospitality.  I look forward to returning one day to your beautiful island for a vacation.  Candi (Oct 2nd) New Orleans USA

      Nicholas, We had an amazing tour and Giannis was excellent. Very pleasant, strong English, very knowledgeable. Haraki village was a perfect stop for swimming in a quiet bay with no hordes of tourists and the Argo restaurant was amazing, reasonably priced and absolutely delicious.  I'll be posting a review on TripAdvisor shortly.  Thanks again,  Amit (Sept 22nd) Yorkshire UK 

      Nicholas, Thank you!! It was a pleasure to meet you. Kostas was great. I wish we could have spent the entire day with him. We truly enjoyed the brief time we had. His knowledge and his ability to communicate were tremendous. Thank you again for making him available.  Warmest regards, Steve (Sept 21th) Alberta Canada

      Hi Nicholas, Thanks again for a wonderful day in Rhodes. We loved the tour and the lunch stop at Argo was fantastic. I will do a TripAdvisor review as well for you and again thank you for making our day special. The group all commented how great a day it was. Kindest regards  Pam (Sept 18th) Arlington, Texas

      Hey Nicholas, We had a great time visiting Rhodes. It is a beautiful island and Mike did a great job showing us around and telling us all about the island. Thank you again for everything. Sharon (Sept 16th) | Cruise & Vacation Consultant.  Expedia Cruise Ship Centers

      Nicholas, Our tour and or driver exceeded our expectations. Stamatis was knowledgeable and helpful. He showed us the highlights of Rhodes and tailored the tour to what we wanted to see. He was able to answer all our questions and provide us with great info about Rhodes and the surrounding areas. Thanks for the service and the Stamatis. We have recommended your service to others who may be going to Rhodes in the future. David (Sept 14th) Denver, Colo.

      Excellent private tour of Rhodes. Driver/Guide was attentive and informative. Highly recommend. Everything went flawlessly, from my first contact with them 6 months prior to our tour until we were dropped off back at the ship. Ken (Sept11th) Baltimore, Md.

      If you're looking for a perfect tour company, this is it. Nicholas found the formula for making the tourist comfortable from beginning to end of trip. Communication was a easy and when Mike came to ship for pickup he was on time and felt more like family member was there to guide us. We had specific wants and needs (we are an active senior couple) and Mike followed our instructions to the letter. We saw as many historical areas as possible in such a short time in a relaxed and slow pace. He even took us to a super market to get the flavor of Rhodes local life. Can't thank you enough Nicholas and Mike. We look forward to returning soon and will contact you as soon as we have a date. Best regards Georgia (Ag 27) San Jose, Calif.

      We (4 of us) pre-booked a private tour for Rhodes. We were here for one day while on a cruise. It was called the "Best of Rhodes" tour and ran for about 5 hours and the email correspondence with Nicholas seemed quite straightforward. We can recommend this tour as alternative to taking a large group tour. It is readily customizable to the needs and interests of your group and very good value. Fernando (Aug 25th) Córdoba Argentina 

      Nicholas, Thank YOU for one of the best tours we have ever had. Tonight, at dinner I raved about the wonderful time we had and how much we learned and enjoyed it. I will recommend it to everyone I know. Please give our best regards to Dominic. He treated us like family. Thank you again.  Esther and Ron (Aug 22nd) Chicago, Ill.

      After a bit of research and communication with Nicholas, we decided the Best of Rhodes half day tour would best fit our group of six adults. We were picked up promptly at the pier where our cruise ship docked. I believe our tour guide was named Dimitri? We had a very skilled driver as well. Dimitri was very enthusiastic! With his sense of humor and wealth of knowledge about Rhodes, it made for a marvelous day! We especially enjoyed Lindos, the medieval city, the beautiful scenery, and a pottery shop! Dimitri even brought us to a traditional Greek eatery in the medieval city that was so good! Thank you, Nicholas, for the great memories!  Jeanne Collins (Aug 8th) Los Angeles, Calif.

      We did a full day tour from our ship. There were 6 of us so we had two drivers, Manuel and Mike, they were the best! We even changed our itinerary when we got off the ship and this was not a problem. We were able to spend as much time as we wanted at each stop. We also decided to let the kids swim and they found the perfect spot with a restaurant overlooking the sea. A great fun filled day was had by all. I would highly recommend this company and our drivers to anyone, if you want to have the best day in Rhodes! Misty (July 20th) San Jose, California

      Hello! We are back in NY and wanted to thank you again for the wonderful day we had in Rhodes. Sergio is terrific and we really enjoyed getting to know him and getting to know Rhodes through him. All the best. Deborah (July 16th) Indianapolis

      Hi Nicholas, we thoroughly enjoyed our visit and will be putting a very good review on TripAdvisor when we return. Please pass on our thanks to Manuel, who did a splendid job and was both helpful and informative.  Kind regards Alan (July 12th) Manchester UK

      Nicholas and our wonderful driver Kuriakos truly gave us a day to remember! The beauty of booking a tour with Nicholas’ company is you get six-star service from the moment of enquiry to the minute you are dropped off - the best tour ever!! Can’t wait to go back to Rhodes so we can meet these lovely people again - can’t recommend them enough! Absolutely brilliant!! Angie and Tommy (July 1st) London UK

      After researching various private tour services of Rhodes, we selected Rhodes Shore Excursions over others because of the positive customer reviews. And we were not disappointed! Our driver Michael arrived on time, confirmed the day's itinerary, and then off we went. Throughout the day he offered (and we gladly accepted) suggestions for side stops on route to our planned stops to the Acropolis and Lindos, St. John's Bay, and then lunch and sunbathing at Haraki Beach. Michael will forever be a part of our memories of Rhodes. A very special day for us.  Carole (July 1st) Philadelphia, Pa.

      Our driver Andreas was ready waiting outside our hotel for us at our arranged time, he was friendly professional and knowledgeable about the island. He took us to some beautiful places, I’m so glad as we would not have seen them by ourselves. Andreas was always on hand to offer advice what to do and where. Our lunch he assured us was delicious and it was the best meal we had in Greece.  Nicola (June 30th) London UK

      Dear Nicholas, Thank you so much for your help and knowledge. You really helped us see the island with kids. I will definitely write on TripAdvisor a good review. soon.  Regards Sruthy and Family (June 26th) Kent UK

      We contacted Nicholas through Trip Advisor, then the e-mail correspondence began and we learned we had options for a group as large as ours. We had 10 people, ages 12 to 61.  Nicholas and his other two drivers, Michael and Steven were waiting for us in air-conditioned cars just outside the disembarkation point from our boat. Nicholas gave us the best experience possible.  Jill and Family (June 24th) Columbus, Ohio

      Nicholas, it was great. Thank you for meeting us before we left. Kostas and Jack went out of their way to help me. We love Rhodes and the tour just made it more beautiful.  Thank you.  Ann (June 20th) Los Angeles, Calif.

      Thank you for the fabulous experience of Rhodes. Mum and I will cherish these beautiful memories always. Michael was the perfect host and great representative for your company - I will add my comments to TripAdvisor in the next few days , thanks again for all the knowledge and your flexibility.  Regards Emy and Parthena (June 19) Sidney AU

      Nicholas, We had a great time with Kostas. We are so happy we did a private tour with your company. He has a wealth of knowledge of the area and was very entertaining. We have received our pottery from Crazy Yanni! OO-PA!  Mike H (June 16th) Washington DC

      We had a wonderful day and Mike was extremely obliging and knowledgeable. He is a careful driver and we enjoyed all the special places he took us. We can highly recommend him and your company to everyone.  All good wishes.  Alex and Ros (June 13th)  Charlotte, N.C

      Nichola, We had a blast with Dominic! He was so great with our kids! A true gem of Rhodes! We certainly will give our driver Dominic and your company a wonderful review on Trip Advisor as soon as we get to Rome on Sunday. Thank you.  Emily (June 12th) Boston, Massachusetts

      I booked a group of 14 people on the Rhodes tour and must say (with all the other 13 in total agreement), this was the "best tour" we went on while cruising the Greek Isles. Kosta (our tour guide) was AWESOME. He is professional, knowledgeable and loves his island of Rhodes. Everyone actively engaged him in conversations about the history and culture and you can tell - he truly loves his job. So, to Kosta...and Nicholas....OPA! I would book this tour again and again.... thanks for making our tour so memorable!  Sandra (June 2nd) Nashville-Davidson

      We had a great day with Manuel our driver travelling all over Rhodes. We spent time on our own to explore Lindos. Manuel tailored our day to our wishes. Our lunch in a picturesque village by the sea was delicious and relaxing. If you want a private shore excursion book with “Rhodes Shore Excursions”. A great day and very memorable.  Jennifer (June 2nd) Baltimore, Md.

      Thank You for making our stop at Rhodes a very nice one, Cheers to Andrew, He was at the very top of his game that day. We enjoyed his company and learned a lot about Greek life. We have not received our pottery as of yet but it may still be a little early. I will keep your business name and Andrew’s name and reference you on to others. Thanks. Richard and Susan (May 26) Fresno, California

      Hi Nicholas, we had a lovely time. A highlight was the lovely restaurant. Will do a review later. Thank You very much. Erica (May 24th) Southampton UK

      Dear Nicholas, We had a wonderful day and Sergio went out of his way to accommodate our wishes.  Thank you. Lesley (May 24th) Sheffield UK

      Thanks a lot, to all of you, we had a very beautiful day in Rhodes. We must go back. Thanks again for the excellent service Patricia and Family (May 10th) Belgium

      Nicholas, Thank You for an outstanding tour. All of us loved the tour and your beautiful Island. The people were friendly everywhere we went. The food was excellent and Michael's choice for lunch was superb. We will be sure to tell all of our friends about your tour and your island. Look forward to someday returning. Michael was an excellent guide the best we have had all week. We will be sure to call when we return.  Best Wishes, Richard W.  (May 3rd) Kansas City, Mo.

      We were a party of 10. Unanimously, we all loved our very comprehensive tour of Rhodes. We found this island to be a hidden gem. We toured the medieval city, so interesting. Our 5-hour tour was perfect! upon return to USA will review with TripAdvisor.  Thank you!  Jane (May 2nd) Austin, Texas

The tour of the island with insight, patience, and a willingness to share observations about the places visited and the lives of people, past, present and future. Much more than a driving tour service! Lindsay F. (Oct 18th) San Diego, Calif.

      Hello Nicholas and Manuel, Thank you for making our short visit to your beautiful island a memorable one. Manuel was very friendly and gave us an insight of Rhodes and the life here. We wish we had more time to spend here and hope to return one day. We would recommend your services to whosoever is interested in a private tour. Cheers to both of you. Nita & Deepak P (Oct 14th) UK

      While in port, took a half day tour of Rhodes with Rhodes Shore Excursions. Nicholas was easy to work with and book before arriving in port. Our driver, Manuel, was prompt, courteous, and knowledgeable. He took us to interesting places and sights on a half day tour of Rhodes and a fantastic restaurant on the water. Best tour value of my cruise. James G. (Oct 11th) Baltimore, Md.

      Hi Nicholas, we enjoyed our tour so much. We really appreciated Giannis. He loves Rhodes and now we do too, Giannis was so knowledgeable. If we get back to Rhodes again, we would request another tour with him. Thank you! Denise (Oct 5th) Louisville-Jefferson County

      We made all our reservations for this tour on-line and the process was handled perfectly with no problems whatsoever. When we arrived in port we were greeted by our driver for the day, Sergio. Sergio was very knowledgeable about the island and the sites we were seeing during the tour.. We also asked him to take us someplace for lunch and his choice did not disappoint. He took us to a quiet little seafood restaurant right on the water where the food was fantastic and the ambiance even better. If you have Rhodes as one of your ports of call on a Mediterranean Cruise then you can't go wrong with booking your private tour with Nicholas A.

      We toured the full island with Nicholas. He was an excellent tour/driver.

This tour was an excellent way to see the sites as well as the full island. Bruce (Aug 2nd) Milwaukee, Wis.

      Hi Nicholas, We had a wonderful time! Thank you!!!  Cheryl (May 10th) UK

      Our most heartfelt thanks for our recent tour of Rhodes with Mike the Taxi Driver; Rhodes Half Day Tour and Lindos. It was a beautiful and just perfect tour with the best weather. The meeting point so close to the ship, meeting you & the driver at the same time, and an early start was a plus for us.

      Mike was specifically professional, safe, and a fountain of knowledge about Rhodes. His tour particularly made our Lindos visit memorable since we enjoyed a maximum amount of time. Lindos was picture perfect, the people so welcoming, and we found the perfect little taverna for lunch run by a family — great tour stop.   Also enjoyed the Pottery Store visit and demonstration; very personable and unique.  Thank you all for a wonderful tour and professionally managed activity. Our best to all of you and the Rhodes stop on our cruise was certainly a highlight!  Clayton J. (May 4th) Minneapolis

      Nicholas, we were very happy with the services you provided. Michael is an excellent and patient driver. We received exactly what we were looking to learn. When I return home, I will post a very positive review on Trip Advisor. Sincerely, Russell F. (April 22nd) Canada

      Hi Nick, Thank you. It was a very good day. I will write on Trip Advisor when I get some better WiFi.  Regards Jane R (April 10th) Toronto Canada

I would certainly recommend Nicholas and associates for your small group tour on Rhodes. Bob (Oct 4th) British Columbia AU

      Dear Nicholas, we have only just returned home after a wonderful trip to Turkey & Greece. One of the highlights we had was seeing the lovely island of Rhodes and although it would still have been beautiful, the tour we did with Yannis, made it all the more special. He brought new ideas and thoughts to our discussions and we found that very interesting - not just a 'tour driver'.  If any of our friends, which some do, are going to Rhodes, we will be more than happy to recommend your services to them.  Thank you again and we will remember Rhodes with much fondness. Regards Gayle H. (Sept 23rd) Long Beach, Calif.

      Nicholas, we enjoyed ourselves very much and Yannis was wonderful. You have a beautiful country and island. We hope to come back! Sincerely, Pam (Sept 20th) Ontario Canada

We had a great time in Rhodes and we enjoyed the tour with Michael and thanks to him, we took the donkey ride to Acropolis of Lindos, which my son had a kick out of it:)) In a few days I’ll try to get on Trip advisor and review the tour, this way other travelers find out about you and the good services you have to offer.  Regards, Marcela (Sept 4th) UK

      Nicholas, my husband and I had the pleasure of taking a tour with Stergos on August. Of all the places we visited on our honeymoon (various throughout Greece & Turkey), we both agreed that Rhodes was our favorite, and a large part of that was because of Stergos and his wonderful tour. We felt so lucky to have had a chance to explore your beautiful island with such a knowledgeable and friendly driver! Thank you!  Kate & George (Aug 19th) New Brunswick Canada

      Hi Nicholas. Just wanted to thank you for a lovely day of touring in Rhodes. Andrew was a terrific tour driver and we would recommend him highly to anyone. He was extremely accommodating, polite and friendly. He had a great sense of humor and was quite knowledgeable. We will be happy to give your name to our friends and hope to visit your country again in the near future. Sincerely, Sandy K and Mark L (July 21) Brisbane AU

      Dear Nicholas, we very much enjoyed Rhodes - Mike was a wonderful tour driver! The little side trip to Anthony Quinn's bay was one of the highlights of our trip! We will post very favorable comments on Trip Advisor as soon as we get over jet lag. Thank you again, Kathryn H. (July 10) Arlington, Texas

      Hello Nicholas; It was our pleasure to meet you at the start of our tour. Manuel did a SUPERB job on showing and explaining the very best.

      Hi Nicholas. We are home, with great memories of our trip. One of our best tours was with Dominic and Michael. They truly presented Rhodes at its best. If we come back, we will definitely be in touch. Thank you, Judith (June 18) New Jersey USA

      Hi Nicholas, we arrived home after our 3-week vacation and just wanted to let you know how much we enjoyed our tour of Rhodes with you. Maybe one day we will make it back to your wonderful island. Take care and thanks again. Sincerely, David and Wendy Z. (June 12) Las Vegas, Josh and Lisa Portland Maine

      Dear Nicholas & Michael, Thank you so much for a memorable trip to Rhodes. Michael was able to show us everything and made it special for us. We were very comfortable and well taken care of. Michael made us feel special.  Photos to follow. Plan on commenting on Trip Advisor as soon as we can get to if. It is difficult getting back to normal life & work after such a beautiful vacation. Michael still said he is better looking than you..Ha, Ha, Ha. Thand you again Nancy & Richie C. Ray & Ruth B. (May 10) Virginia Beach, Va.

      I wanted you to know the tour today was FANTASTIC! Thank you and thanks Sergio our driver, I will be in touch! Mindy A. Cruises Plus - Just Go Away - (April 15) Huntingdon Valley, PA

      My wife and I enjoyed a 4-hour 1/2-day tour of Rhodes with Nick last week. Nick was very reliable, informative, and flexible with our schedule. Our tour covered every important site we wanted to visit, including Lindos. We recommend Nick. Price for tour was about 80 Euros more than Cruise Line offered. If there were two couples, it would have been less expensive than the cruise line tour which we learned was very poorly done and very little information imparted. R. Schwartz, MD, (Oct 28) Vienna, VA

      Hi, Nicholas! We had such a good time with you. A friend of ours was just here. She was on Oceanic Cruise Lines while we were on the Symphony and we were on the Amalfi Coast on the same day but didn't see each other. Actually, her ship had to dock in Naples instead of Positano. Anyhow, I was telling her about our day with you and with Dimitris on Santorini. Both of you were great. Thank you so much for a wonderful day. We love the way you eat! I told you I was a travel agent for 40 years so if any of my friends in the business need a contact for Rhodes, you are it. Best wishes to you and your family, and thanks again. When I'm back to normal I'll email a few photos to you. Debra (Oct 20) New Orleans, La.

      My husband and I had a great day's tour with Nicholas. He picked us up from our hotel in the old town, not easy as it's practically a pedestrianized zone, made sure we saw what we wanted to see, rather than taking us on a predetermined route and helped us to find things we'd never have found on our own. We particularly appreciated being left at the top of the Valley of the Butterflies so we could walk down and meet at the bottom, rather than having to start at the bottom walk up and then back down again. A thoroughly enjoyable day with interesting chat about what is currently happening in Greece.  Thank you Diana (Oct 15) Alberta Canada

      Nicholas tailored our 5 hours together to our interests and was faithful to the ship's schedule. He took us to locations on Rhodes that the tour buses can't (don't) go which reflected the beauty of the island. Lunch was at a uncrowded location alongside a bay with excellent food and service. We covered all sections of Rhodes in a comfortable Mercedes sedan. We enjoyed his company and got to know him (and he us) personally. Highly recommend. Stuart R.  (Oct 6) San Francisco, Calif.

      We had an incredible experience in Rhodes. MIchael was great and took us in a short time to many beautiful sites. We definitely recommend Nicholas company in Rhodes! Sara (Sept 20) London UK

      We first contacted Nicholas when we decided to spend a day in a Lindos resort, we were just looking for a car service to take us from the pier to the resort. Nicholas suggested a short tour prior to going to the resort, we are so glad he did! We were picked up by Stamos who was such a pleasure to be with, he was so passionate and proud to show us his beautiful island of Rhodes. I had no idea of how beautiful this island was, he took us to many places in that short time. We even went to a ceramic factory where we watched them make something, we were able to purchase a few items which I can't wait to use! We were picked up promptly and taken back to the pier, Stamos was still showing us sites on our way back! We couldn't have been happier, the day was spectacular thanks to Nicolas, Stamos and Rhodes Private Tours! I would recommend them to all my friends and clients!  Joanne S. (Sept 15) Northern NJ

      Thank you so much for the excellent service provided by Michael. I'll be sure to write a review and will pass your name along to our friends. All the best, Jan G. (Sept 7) Los Angeles, California

      We booked a half day tour with Nicholas before we left Australia. The booking was handled very professionally and the arrangements for meeting the cruise ship and collecting us from the wharf went without a hitch. Our driver was Michael (a former Australian citizen) and he gave us a wonderful tour of the island and all the highlights and took us to a very good restaurant for lunch before returning us to the ship. We would highly recommend this service. S & D (Aug 8) Perth AU

      Dear Nick. We just arrived back after a wonderful holiday and thank you for being a wonderful driver for 2 full days doing the East and West coast of Rhodes. We thoroughly enjoyed your country and your attentive and knowledgeable service. We saw so much and learned a lot about the island and its rich history. We also experienced some lovely food in interesting spots. Once again many thanks Dr. Mohan and Dr. Sumi and Tamara (July 23) UK

      Bonjour Nicolas. Nous avons été absolument ravis de notre visite à Rhodes. Votre service était impeccable et les chauffeurs très professionnels et sympathique. Nous reviendrons sur Rhodes pour visiter toutes les richesse de votre île merveilleuse. Encore un grande merci pour ces moment inoubliables. Cordialement Christelle (July 17) Quebec Canada

      HI, Nick and Dominic, We enjoyed our tour of Rhodes -- personal service, professional in every way, and great information on Rhodes, past and present. The car was perfect for a hot day and sure beat the buses on the cruise excursions. Our tour group included an 82-year woman who had some limitations on her ability to climb steps or ride the donkeys to Lindos - a must do for everyone visiting Rhodes -- but Dominic found a way to get her to town where she could shop while we saw the ruins. Dominic, thank you for a great visit. We will certainly share your name with friends who are travelling to your wonderful island. Thank you! Sally Q. (June 19) Arlington, Virginia PS: loved the oranges from your grove. thank you.

      Hello Nick, we made it home safely and with lots of wonderful memories and photos to share. Our day in Rhodes with you is a highlight of our Mediterranean vacation. Thanks again for providing us with such a wonderful tour. Your well thought out itinerary of our day in Rhodes left no sight unseen. We especially enjoyed the historical notes you provided, and were very impressed with your knowledge and insight. Lunch at Argo was exactly what one would expect to find in Greece, very delicious food in a perfect setting; a definite five-star restaurant. We had a fabulous time and are so looking forward to another visit. Thanks again, Kelli & Bob R, Teri & Gary N. (June 14) Chicago, Ill. USA

      Hi Nicholas, Thank you for a wonderful tour of Rhodes with your brother Michael! Lel and I really enjoyed it! Hopefully I will make it back in the not so distant future. Best of luck to you. Warm Regards, Stephen (May 16) Manitoba Canada

      Dear Nicholas: We had a pleas ant journey back home except for a bit of wind on our last day, but we survived. We all want to say thank you for your help and assistance and all the useful tips and information. We all had a wonderful time on your fantastic Island of Rhodes, thanks to you. We still talk about it and we are always telling our friends what a great time we had. We all hope to come again to Rhodes and spend more days, and we will look forward to seeing you again. We are recommending you and your excellent service to all our friends and family. Take care, and the best of Luck in your business for the future. Best regards Dominic (April 10) Malta. Gozo

      Dear Nicholas. We are still on Cruise and therefore my belated thank you, for an excellent tour of Rhodes and Lindos. It was a relief to step off the ship on a cold and windy day and find you waiting for us, as planned. Your insight into anything of consequence on the Island, was extremely interesting and informative, giving us a very good insight into Rhodes. I especially enjoyed the Street of the Knights and Lindos. Again, a heartfelt thank you, from myself and the family, as it felt more like a family friend showing us around, rather than being on a tour. Sincerely Bill O (Oct 22) South Africa

      Hi Nicholas. We are home safe. The rest of our trip was as wonderful as our Rhodes tour. Got some great pictures. Spent time at the synagogue and wandered around the old Town. Love Rhodes and telling everyone about it and will recommend you. Thank you Arleen M (Oct 14) El Paso, Tex.

      Dear Nicholas. I just wanted you to know how much we enjoyed having Dominic show is around Rhodes. He did a wonderful job and I appreciate his patience very much. Sincerely. Sue (Oct 12) NJ USA

      Hi Nick. We very much enjoyed our trip to Rhodes and our time with you. We will definitely be back and will certainly refer any people who are travelling to your beautiful island to your services. Brian (Sept 25) Canada

      Thanks Nick. We thoroughly enjoyed our visit and definitely will recommend you to anyone visiting your beautiful island. Rick P. (Sept 18) Poland

      Hello. We had a wonderful tour with Michael in Rhodes. We loved Rhodes and hope to visit again in the future. Thanks. Kathy (Sept 9) Gold Coast–Tweed Heads AU

      Nick. We really enjoyed our time in Rhodes and certainly hope to return, and if we do, we will definitely use your services. We will also highly recommend you. I have been working on our photo albums from the trip and we are all still awed by how beautiful Rhodes was… thanks again for all your help...Ruth S. (Aug 10) Atlanta, Ga.

      Nicholas. The wonderful tour that you gave us was one of the highlights of our trip! You gave us lots of information and showed us many interesting parts of Rhodes. It was truly a pleasure being shown Rhodes by you. We will certainly not hesitate to recommend you to anyone who is looking for a wonderful experience on your island. Thank you again for helping us to have such a wonderful experience! Hazel B. (Aug 3) Philadelphia, Pa.

      Nicholas. Thank you so much for the wonderful tour in Rhodes. We were met by our driver at the port on time. He was informative and very attentive to my husband's needs. I had enough time to visit the sights that my husband was not able to while he stayed in the car with the driver. We were very satisfied. You delivered exactly what you said you would. We would recommend your company to our friends and family. Sincerely, Max, Karen and Sue (July 18) New Jersey USA

      Nicholas: After 12 days in Greece and 4 islands, one of the best memories of our trip was the day we had Michael show us around Rhodes. Not only was he on time, but he was a wonderful host and wealth of information throughout the day. He was very personable and helped us understand Greek culture and what it is like to be Greek in today's environment. The customized day trip was perfect as it gave us a true taste of Rhodes and the amazing landscape that we saw make us want to visit again and again. The dinner recommendations capped off a perfect day and we even saw Michaelis at the fountain square! We both highly recommend your services and your tour. It was wonderful. Regards, Kevin & Monique S. (July 11) Ontario Canada

      Nicholas, We had such a great time, thank you. We will definitely pass along your name to our friends that you are the guy to get in touch with for Rhodes. We wish you much luck and business. Regards, The Cushners (July 7) British Columbia Canada

      Hi Nicholas, Thanks, we had a great time. Laura and I both thought our Rhodes tour was one of the best of our entire trip. Let me know if I can provide a review or recommendation to anyone. Thanks, Larry & Laura (June 16) Albuquerque, N.M.

      Hi Nicholas, Kim and I had a great ride to the airport with you but we had a fabulous two days with Michael touring around the island. Michael was fun and informative, giving us options as we went along to go with our interests. He really made sure that the time we spent with him was packed full of the sights, history and legends of Rhodes. Michael never rushed us but offered his opinion when asked for what we should see. We got much more than we had planned and really appreciate his expertise as well as his excellent driving skills. Michael was always on time or a little early for our appointed meetings and knew all of the good lookout points for photographs. When he took us on a short trip to Ialyssos and the Monastery of Filerimos, he suggested a short stop at the Acropolis of Rhodes, telling us of the acoustics of the theater. It was amazing! And because he brought us there early, we were totally alone. Rhodes is a beautiful island and we enjoyed getting a taste of the countryside and small towns. We loved climbing to the castles, not as difficult as the guidebooks indicate. Our first glimpse of the D'Amboise Gate was one I will never forget. A very grateful thank you from Kim and Becky to Michael and Nicholas and to George in Athens who recommended this company. We had a wonderful time. Thanks for the memories. Kim and Becky (May 12) Tucson, Arizona

      Hello Nick, We are home now and had a very enjoyable holiday and trip. Thank you for the tour which you gave us, it was really enjoyed by us all and especially in view of Bruce's disability worked really well for us and was one of the highlights of the trip. We appreciated the knowledge and information, which you have of the area and also the meal at the local restaurant, which you took us to. We would be happy to recommend your services and tours to anyone heading over your way. Hope that the season is going well for you. Thanks, and all the best.

      Dear Nicholas, you certainly made our stay in Rhodes interesting and FUN!!! We really feel as though we know you as a friend. We look forward to seeing you again, and perhaps staying on the island for a little beach holiday. The island is beautiful. I will, of course, let you know if I have any clients who will be coming to Rhodes. Thank you for everything, and I agree, let's stay in touch. Fondly, Karen.

      Nick, First and foremost thank you for the wonderful 1/2-day tour of Rhodes. From beginning to end, you made sure that we did not miss a thing. We are eternally grateful for that. Your insight and patience was well appreciated. We also appreciated you going out of your way to get us some delicious "baklava" and "galaktoboureko". Rhodes was one of the highlights of our cruise trip, all thanks to you. We hope to visit again soon. If we do, know that you will be the first person we call. I will certainly recommend you to all of my friends. Thanks again. Torres Family (June 23) USA

      Dear Nicholas, the four of are still talking about our Rhodes tour as the "Highlight" of our trip! We had a wonderful time, and have threatened to come back and buy an olive grove and live there. We truly loved your island. Our driver (cannot remember his name-what was it, please?) was charming and informative and friendly. We will certainly call you again should we get back to Rhodes and recommend your tour to any of our friends traveling to Rhodes.  Rick & Joy (Oct 17th) USA

      Hi Nicholas. Our tour of Rhodes, Filermos and Lindos with Michael was relaxing, informative and quite enjoyable. We appreciated how he managed our time so that we were able to see as much as possible. Rhodes is definitely an island we would love to visit again. Thank you. Charlene & Ed P. (Sept 15) UK

      Nicholas. You have a good eye when taking photos. You took one of our family with the harbor scene in the background. It was so good that I had copies made and I’ll included them in many of my Christmas cards. Our visit to Rhodes is fondly remembered and you helped make the experience special. Thank you. If I know of anyone coming to Rhodes, you may be assured that I will heartily recommend your service. And a very special holiday season is wished for you and your family. Roxanna C. (Aug 20) Nova Scotia Canada

      Hi Nicholas: ...We did have a fabulous continuation of our trip ending in Istanbul. The weather continued to be wonderful so we saw everything in its best glory. Judy and I wish you and your family all the best, and we do look forward to enjoying your smiling services again in beautiful Rhodes... Our best, Bob and Judy B. (July 14) Darwin AU

      Hello Nick, I just wanted to let you know that my cousin, Linda Babcock, and I are thinking of you during the holidays and remembering our fantastic tour with you. I have recommended your services to my friend, Ana Mellon, who is visiting Rhodes in April, 2010 with great enthusiasm!! "She won't miss a trick with Nick" right? Remembering you and your amazing gift for finding just the right places to go (specially to put my foot in the sea) and we loved the restaurant, and the meliasti...can't wait to return! Have a wonderful holiday season. Betty C. (May 12) Jacksonville, Fla.

      Nicholas - Thank you for your services. We had a wonderful trip. Michael did a wonderful job and was a great host. Please thank him on our behalf. We were captivated by Rhodes, and indeed, all of the islands we visited. You have a beautiful country. Thank you, Bob S. (Sept 23) Denver, Colo.

      Nicholas, Fabulous tour. Thank you so much. I can't tell you how much we enjoyed the day. Your sense of humor, knowledge of the area and fabulous suggestions made for the perfect day.

Many regards and if you even come to the west coast of Florida, please give me a call. Regards, Kelly S, Boulder V. (Aug 14) Florida West Coast

      Nicholas, thank you so very much for an outstanding tour of Rhodes. My friends and I were impressed with your knowledge of the island and our trip was more memorable because of you. I especially enjoyed the phyllo pastry with honey at the Restaurant; the flavor was exceptional. You were so kind to take us there for lunch. Good luck to you and thanks again for a terrific tour! Judy G. (July 10) Louisville-Jefferson

      Hi Nicholas, we wanted to thank you again for taking us on a tour of Rhodes. Rhodes was one of our favorite places, and we saw much more of the island on your tour than we would have with a shore excursion from the cruise line. I appreciated the fact that we were able to stop for pictures in several spots, and we never felt rushed while we explored sites on our own. If I have friends going to Rhodes, I'll be sure to recommend you for a tour! Thanks, Rebecca and William (June 20) Brisbane AU

      Dear Nick. Thank you so much, we had such a wonderful vacation. We love Greece !!!!!!!! Thank you for making our trip so great. You were the best!! Crete and Santorini were also great. Keep in touch with us! When you come to the USA, call us. We will tell everyone about how great you were and how much fun we had with you. We miss the scenery, the food, our new friends. Thank you again. Jeri and Walter (Oct 12) Toronto Canada

      Hi Michael and Nicholas. Thanks so much for making the trip to Rhodes as good as it could possibly have been. We enjoyed your driving us around the island, stopping at the sites we wanted to visit and showing us things, we never would have known about otherwise. We loved the donkey ride at Lindos and the lunch prepared by the sisters, the Three Musketeers, at the church at the top of the Valley of the Butterflies was wonderful. It was also very nice to walk downhill in that lovely valley instead of hiking the distance uphill. We did notice that any temple, fortress, walled city or other important site in Greece is located on the top of the highest, steepest mountain around, so it was nice for once to only have to walk down. Thank you again and I hope to get back to Rhodes someday. I'll surely call you if I do! Nina W. (Sept 24) Wichita, Kansas

      Thank you for your wonderful service. We enjoyed our brief visit to Rhodes and Michael's tour certainly made it worthwhile. Of the three car tours we took in different areas, yours stands out. We saw our friends yesterday who also took your tour last month, and enjoyed reminiscing about the interesting sites we all saw. Again, thank you. Phyllis, Jerry and Allison S. (Aug 28) New York

      Thank you so much for a memorable day! Manolis, our driver, was absolutely wonderful and his great, sunny personality made our day. He even did a little Greek dance with me! We will definitely recommend your services to friends - and Manolis in particular! THANK YOU! Susanne (July 17) Ontario Canada

      Efkaristo !! Dominique was a fantastic driver. Thanks for a very special day. Feel free to use us as a reference anytime! hope to see you in Rodos again sometime. Lou G. (June 10) Belgium

      Honest. Reliable. Knowledgeable. Trustworthy. These are just a few of the words I can use to express my feelings towards Nick and his very professional team. We arrived to Rhodes during an extremely busy period with over 7,000 people traveling to the island. Despite this chaos, Nick and his team showed us and our guests a fantastic and highly enjoyable time. We toured the island, leisurely and Nick never missed a photo opportunity or chance to share an extra special tid-bit of information regarding the island. He made sure we maximized our time in all of the "right" places and his recommendations for restaurants were BEYOND perfect. I commend Nick for a job well done and thank him personally for going above and beyond any expectation that I had of a "city tour". Thanks again, Nick!!!! Sincerely, Faaizah Al-Q. (Oct 29) Dubai, UAE

      Nicholas - Thank you so much for a fabulous day! We especially LOVED our swim at Lindos followed by the delicious Rodos wine! I have a terrific picture of you that I will forward when I get a chance to upload it. Thanks again for a terrific trip! Best regards, Penny and Doug, David and Corinne, ALTOUR (Sept 23) USA

      Hello, We just wanted to drop a short note to you to thank you and Michael once again for the fabulous tour of Rhodes! We all had a great time and appreciated all of the wonderful sights you showed us. We would definitely recommend both of you to any of our friends traveling to Rhodes! Wishing you both the best! Amanda F. (Aug 27) Yukon Canada

      Nickolas, We have just returned from our big adventure and I must say you made part of it very nice. We so enjoyed spending the day with you on Rhodes. It was one of our best ports of the cruise. It was nice to visit the restaurant where the owner’s wife was from the states. What a nice man he was to sit with us and talk about home. Thank you for all the information you provided and I will definitely recommend you to my friends and family. Thanks again Claudia & John W. (July 10) Los Angeles, California

      My wife and I just wanted to say thank you for the wonderful tour we had with Michael. The professionalism of your services and thoroughness of showing us around Rhodes was exceptional. Michael was very knowledgeable and made us feel very relaxed in allowing us to tailor the tour to just what we wanted to see. The valley of the butterflies was a once in a life time trip. Michael also gave us some great tips on Greek food It was the best way to start off our introduction of Rhodes. Efharisto! Again, Thank you. Dave and Marie S. (June 30) Ohio, USA
