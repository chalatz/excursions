#### Back to the ship on time

##### Enjoy a Worry-Free shore excursion in Rhodes Island with our detailed arrangements from the beginning to the end.

We don't require booking deposit or prepayment for private excursions by sedan cars.  If weather conditions or other reasons cause your cruise ship to change its itinerary and not arrive in port, we lose the job, but you don't lose money.

If the ship arrives late into port, we'll adjust our schedules, and the rental time will start from the moment you meet your driver-without you losing time and money.

Our associate fleet of cars is maintained and kept in quality condition. In the unlikely event of mechanical failure, we will resolve the matter within 10 - 20 minutes. As we corporate with the biggest transfers companies on the island a simple phone call ensures that your tour will not be disrupted and that you are safely returned to your ship in time for departure.

Bon Voyage!

#### Shore Excursion Safety

#### Your safety is of the utmost importance to us.

Planning your own shore excursion means going where you want to go!!  We offer fully-customizable shore excursions to suit your special needs, including no strenuous walking or climbing for people with physical limitations. You can change or extend the itinerary in advance (or on the go) of your private shore excursion as you wish. You may also add attractions or plan your own small group shore excursion: consider, for example, scenic shore excursions, cultural shore excursions, or water sports excursions.  

If you like, you can extend your half day excursion and add lunch time at a seaside village, right on the water's edge, or at a traditional local tavern and taste the Rhodian cuisine and our excellent local wines. We are very flexible and we design the excursions according to your wishes...
