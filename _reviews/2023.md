Nicholas, the tour of Rhodes was great. Rhodes was our favorite of the 5 ports of Greece we visited. Kostas went above what we expected.  Thanks, Dennis S.  (June 9th) Broomall, Pennsylvania, US	

Nickolas, I want to thank you for the very good Rhodes Tour.  Stamos was so kind and helpful.  He was just what we needed.  Our previous tour in Israel required far more walking than some of us were comfortable with so it was a welcome relief when Stamos worked the tour around our needs.  He has a wonderful sense of humor and a very pleasant personality.  A real asset to your staff.  Once again, thanks for a lovely time. Kind Regards, Marlene M. (June 8th) Apple Valley, Minnesota, USA


Nicholas, we all thoroughly enjoyed the tour and seeing your beautiful Rhodes.  Kostas was a wealth of knowledge and made the tour a great experience.  Manolis was a wonderful driver who made us feel very safe.  Thank you all for a very memorable day. Eileen, Al & group (June 2nd) Chatsworth Los Angeles, CA

Thanks Nick. We had a great day with Kostas and a wonderful lunch at Argo Restaurant.  Will pass on your contacts to Danielle Smith our travel agent in Sydney.  Stay safe and well.  Brian & Fay T. (1st June) Sydney. NSW Australia

Nicholas, we had the best time! Alex was wonderful and is a great representative of your company and the island of Rhodes. I can’t say enough about his professionalism, flexibility and willingness to accommodate our needs.
Thank you again, Sue B. (May 25th) Wyoming, Michigan USA

We took a tour of Rhodes and Giannis was our tour/driver.  He took us around the island. He had many stories and was well organized. This was a great tour with no hidden surprises or unexpected shopping stops.  I would recommend this tour company to everyone. Wendy L. (May 22th) Cullowhee, North Carolina. US

Hi Nicholas and Kostas. As I think about the full trip, and the stops in Greece, Turkey and Israel, my mind keeps wondering back to Rhodes.  What a magnificent day!  Kostas made our visit extraordinary. His hospitality and generosity of spirit and story made the visit far more than a tour of the sights and sounds, but a window into the wonder of the island and its unique history. Thank you for all the moments that I will keep close to my heart for years to come.  I hope life will find me back in Rhodes before too long — Stacy S. (May 18th) Marina del Rey, CA, US  

Hello, we were very happy with all the good information that Michael gave us on our tour.  He has a very good knowledge of Rhodes.  The car was comfortable and he was a careful driver. Thanks for making our visit to Rhodes a good one!  The Tanners (May 10th) Sandersville, Georgia US

Dear Nicholas, we have been very impressed with the level of service you have offered and please pass on our thanks to Apostolos who was an excellent and safe driver as well as being a fine representative of your company and very helpful.  I assure you we will recommend your company to anyone we know who may come to your lovely island.  Best regards from all of us, Roger Β. (10 May) United Kingdom

Hi Nicholas, I can’t say enough kind things about the tour, our fantastic guide and professional driver.  The day was a complete success and we’re sorry that three of our friends couldn’t join us. I’ll be very happy to write a glowing review when I return home.  Thank you for providing such exceptional service. Nancy K. and Friends (May 5th) USA

Hi Nick, we had a wonderful time. Anastasia, was the perfect guide. We learned not only about the past but also about the present. The tour was amazing. Thank you for taking care of us. Bozena and Friends (April 26th) Chicago, Illinois, USA

Dear Nick, thank you for organizing a wonderful tour - we thoroughly enjoyed our time on Rhodes. Please pass our thanks on to Gianis.  Kind regards Kristen and Family (16th April) Australia

Hi Nicholas, just wanted to say thank you from all of us as we had a fantastic day out and Michael was a fantastic driver. It was a perfect way to see more of the island and Ray and I would love to come back to spend more time in some of the places. Luca loved hearing about the history (he was quiet but enjoys taking it all in). Nina (5th April) Crick, Northamptonshire, UK

Nicholas, we had a wonderful time on this beautiful island..even with the cold windy weather. Michael did an excellent job of showing us the highlights as well as sharing his vast knowledge of the history of the island. Can't wait to return someday!! Nancy and Beth (March 11th) US


Nicholas Good afternoon! We had an absolutely wonderful day in Rhodes with Stergos. Every aspect of our tour was perfect. Thank you, thank you. Should we ever have the good fortune to return to Rhodes we will be certain to reserve another tour with your company. All the best to you in 2023.
