Hello, we were very happy with all the good information that Michael gave us on our tour.  He has a very good knowledge of Rhodes.  The car was comfortable and he was a careful driver. Thanks for making our visit to Rhodes a good one!  **The Tanners (May 10th) Sandersville, Georgia US**

Dear Nicholas, we have been very impressed with the level of service you have offered and please pass on our thanks to Apostolos who was an excellent and safe driver as well as being a fine representative of your company and very helpful.  I assure you we will recommend your company to anyone we know who may come to your lovely island.  **Best regards from all of us, Roger Β. (10 May) United Kingdom**

Hi Nicholas, I can’t say enough kind things about the tour, our fantastic guide and professional driver.  The day was a complete success and we’re sorry that three of our friends couldn’t join us. I’ll be very happy to write a glowing review when I return home.  Thank you for providing such exceptional service. Nancy K. and Friends (May 5th) USA

Hi Nicholas, just wanted to say thank you from all of us as we had a fantastic day out and Michael was a fantastic driver. It was a perfect way to see more of the island and Ray and I would love to come back to spend more time in some of the places. Luca loved hearing about the history (he was quiet but enjoys taking it all in). Nina (5th April) Crick, Northamptonshire, UK

Nicholas, we had a wonderful time on this beautiful island..even with the cold windy weather. Michael did an excellent job of showing us the highlights as well as sharing his vast knowledge of the history of the island. Can't wait to return someday!! Nancy and Beth (March 11th) US


Nicholas Good afternoon! We had an absolutely wonderful day in Rhodes with Stergos. Every aspect of our tour was perfect. Thank you, thank you.
