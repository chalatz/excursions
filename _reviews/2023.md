We had a wonderful time on this beautiful island..even with the cold windy weather. Michael did an excellent job of showing us the highlights as well as sharing his vast knowledge of the history of the island. Can't wait to return someday!! Nancy and Beth (March 11th) US


Nicholas Good afternoon! We had an absolutely wonderful day in Rhodes with Stergos. Every aspect of our tour was perfect. Thank you, thank you. Should we ever have the good fortune to return to Rhodes we will be certain to reserve another tour with your company. All the best to you in 2023.
