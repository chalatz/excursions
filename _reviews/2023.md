Hi Nicholas, I can’t say enough kind things about the tour, our fantastic guide and professional driver.  The day was a complete success and we’re sorry that three of our friends couldn’t join us. I’ll be very happy to write a glowing review when I return home.  Thank you for providing such exceptional service. Nancy (May 5th) USA

Hi Nick, we had a wonderful time. Anastasia, was the perfect guide. We learned not only about the past but also about the present. The tour was amazing. Thank you for taking care of us. Bozena and Friends (April 26th) Chicago, Illinois, USA

Dear Nick, thank you for organizing a wonderful tour - we thoroughly enjoyed our time on Rhodes. Please pass our thanks on to Gianis.  Kind regards Kristen and Family (16th April) Australia

Hi Nicholas, just wanted to say thank you from all of us as we had a fantastic day out and Michael was a fantastic driver. It was a perfect way to see more of the island and Ray and I would love to come back to spend more time in some of the places. Luca loved hearing about the history (he was quiet but enjoys taking it all in). Nina (5th April) Crick, Northamptonshire, UK

Nicholas, we had a wonderful time on this beautiful island..even with the cold windy weather. Michael did an excellent job of showing us the highlights as well as sharing his vast knowledge of the history of the island. Can't wait to return someday!! Nancy and Beth (March 11th) US


Nicholas Good afternoon! We had an absolutely wonderful day in Rhodes with Stergos. Every aspect of our tour was perfect. Thank you, thank you. Should we ever have the good fortune to return to Rhodes we will be certain to reserve another tour with your company. All the best to you in 2023.
