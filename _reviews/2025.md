Thank you, Nicholas. We had a lovely day exploring Rhodes and George was fantastic! I’ve just completed a 5-star review on Viator for you. Thank you for accommodating our preferences too, it was very much appreciated.  Sharon W. and Family (9th July) Australia 

Hi Nicholas! I will be sure to leave a more detailed review online when we get home, but we had a wonderful day. Manuel was fantastic! Our son (7) easily gets car sick but Manuel was able to make extra stops anytime he felt bad to keep him from getting sick. This ensured we had the best time. He was amazing! Thanks again for an unforgettable tour! Please share our appreciation with Manuel!.  Jennifer L. (July 8th)  Knoxville, TN USA

Hi Nick, I just wanted to share how much we enjoyed our time on Rhodes and to commend Kostas for being an outstanding guide. From the seamless booking process to the tour itself, everything was an absolute pleasure. Your call via Kostas was a thoughtful touch, and I truly appreciated you taking the time to personally introduce yourself at the beginning of the tour, it’s those little details that make a great customer experience even better.  Thank you again for making our too-brief time in Rhodes such a fantastic experience! Paul G. (March 10th) Farmington, CT, USA
