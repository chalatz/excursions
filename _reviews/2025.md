Thank you very much, Nick!  My group thoroughly enjoyed the company of Giannis and Manolis. Giannis’s guidance, explanations in Spanish, and his patience were truly appreciated. Because of this, we will carry Rhodes in our hearts. Thank you again! Silvia and Group (June 3rd) Costa Rica

We had such a wonderful time with Michael!!! He was so knowledgeable about your beautiful island and showed us the best views and sites of Rhodes. He was also so helpful in accommodating my husband with his disability needs.  Best Regards Stella and John K. (May 23rd) Aurora, Illinois, USA

Hi Nick, I just wanted to share how much we enjoyed our time on Rhodes and to commend Kostas for being an outstanding guide. From the seamless booking process to the tour itself, everything was an absolute pleasure. Your call via Kostas was a thoughtful touch, and I truly appreciated you taking the time to personally introduce yourself at the beginning of the tour, it’s those little details that make a great customer experience even better.  Thank you again for making our too-brief time in Rhodes such a fantastic experience! Paul G. (March 10th) Farmington, CT, USA

Dear Nicholas, Kostas and Savas were fantastic companions on our tour. I must say, Kostas' knowledge of the tour's objectives was truly exceptional.
