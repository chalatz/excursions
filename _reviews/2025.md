Hi Nick, I just wanted to share how much we enjoyed our time on Rhodes and to commend Kostas for being an outstanding guide. From the seamless booking process to the tour itself, everything was an absolute pleasure. Your call via Kostas was a thoughtful touch, and I truly appreciated you taking the time to personally introduce yourself at the beginning of the tour, itâ€™s those little details that make a great customer experience even better.  Thank you again for making our too-brief time in Rhodes such a fantastic experience! Paul G. (March 10th) Farmington, CT, USA

Dear Nicholas, Kostas and Savas were fantastic companions on our tour. I must say, Kostas' knowledge of the tour's objectives was truly exceptional. I will definitely return to Rhodes with more friends and plan to engage your services again. Wishing you all the best in the meantime. Kind regards, Collin A. (Jan 15th) Singapore
