Hello Nick:  We really enjoyed our day on Rhodes.  Andrew was a wonderful guide and we really enjoyed meeting him.  Thanks for taking such good care of us! All the best, Ray & Monica E. (Feb 21st)  Millerton, New York, USA

Dear Nicholas, Kostas and Savas were fantastic companions on our tour. I must say, Kostas' knowledge of the tour's objectives was truly exceptional. I will definitely return to Rhodes with more friends and plan to engage your services again. Wishing you all the best in the meantime. Kind regards, Collin A. (Jan 15th) Singapore
