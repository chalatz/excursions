Dear Nicholas, we had a wonderful time touring your beautiful island!  Michael not only had an amazing knowledge of the history of the many sights we saw, but he also shared amusing stories that kept us all laughing.

Nicholas, Kostas proved to be an outstanding guide. His wealth of knowledge and captivating presentation of Rhodes's history, along with insights into its current status within Greece, were truly impressive. We thoroughly enjoyed his sense of humor.
