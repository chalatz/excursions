Nicholas, Kostas proved to be an outstanding guide. His wealth of knowledge and captivating presentation of Rhodes's history, along with insights into its current status within Greece, were truly impressive. We thoroughly enjoyed his sense of humor. The seafood restaurant he selected for lunch in Archangelos village was a highlight, offering a picturesque setting, delectable cuisine, and warm hospitality. Thank you for the great service!!
