Dear Nicholas, we had a wonderful time touring your beautiful island!  Michael not only had an amazing knowledge of the history of the many sights we saw, but he also shared amusing stories that kept us all laughing.  We wanted to have some genuine Greek food for lunch and also taste and buy some local wines and he made it happen.  We are so pleased with our experience and I personally will be writing a 5-star review once I get home.  Thanks again for a great tour! Helen E. (May 1st) California. US

Nicholas, Kostas proved to be an outstanding guide. His wealth of knowledge and captivating presentation of Rhodes's history, along with insights into its current status within Greece, were truly impressive. We thoroughly enjoyed his sense of humor. The seafood restaurant he selected for lunch in Archangelos village was a highlight, offering a picturesque setting, delectable cuisine, and warm hospitality. Thank you for the great service!!
